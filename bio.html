			<div id="bio-text">
				<p>I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown in 2019 with a BS in 
				Computer Engineering. While I was completing my undergrad, I worked consistently 
				for my student newspaper, The Advocate, and served in News, Features and Opinions page editor
				positions. I also was a constant staff writer and copy editor. I loved the paper, even between 
				group coding projects in C# and Java, and tried to keep both in my life.</p>

				<p>After graduation, I worked as a software consultant for a small company, picking up Python and OpenCV. 
				I helped to tinker and tweak a pill-counting machine, working on not only the motors, cameras and sensors, 
				but also a new user interface and video-processing logic.</p>

				<p>But I didn't have time to write, as well. I decided I needed to feed both halves of my brain.</p>

				<p>So I made the leap. I completed a masters degree in journalism at the University of Maryland 
				in May 2022. I focused on data journalism, but also learned web development for the first time.
				I worked on some incredible, collaborative investigations for the Howard Center, some of which 
				even won awards. I made news apps for exploring databases of findings. I crafted interactive maps
				aplenty. I taught myself JavaScript over winter break, and a world opened up to me. </p>

				<p>Out of grad school, I was picked up by USA TODAY Network's Storytelling Studio, a team of brilliant devlopers
				making new, wild, bold interactives and web components and databases to support digital article presentations.
				My understanding of JS and CSS exploded. I learned Svelte, Node, Golang and Scrollama. I made 
				scolling narratives that twist maps and models at each step to visually explain investigations. I made it easier 
				for series of articles to pull the same data powering recirculation. I even made some data graphics.
				</p>

				<p>As always, I'm looking forward to what puzzles the future brings. No matter where I end up or what
				community I end up serving, I know I'll be fulfilling a calling, creating change and empowering
				my fellow humans. We're called to take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them,
				and that's what I plan to do!</p>
