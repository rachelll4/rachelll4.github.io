			<div id="bio-text">
				I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown in 2019 with a BS in 
				Computer Engineering. While I was completing my undergrad, I worked consistently 
				for my student newspaper, The Advocate, and served in News, Features and Opinions page editor
				positions. I also was a constant staff writer and copy editor.
				<br><br>
				After graduation, I worked as a software consultant for one year. I helped to hone a
				pill-counting machine, working on not only the motors, cameras and sensors, 
				but also the user interface and business logic. I learned Python to work with OpenCV.
				<br><br>
				But I didn't have time to write, as well. I decided I needed to feed both halves of my brain.
				<br><br>
				Now, I'm finishing a University of Maryland masters degree in journalism, and 
				I expect to graduate in May 2022. I'm focusing on data journalism, but I'm also building
				web and graphic development skills. I've told very personal stories that stretch from 
				individuals to government entities, but I've also integrated data anytime it's relevant--
				and it usually is. 
				<br><br>
				As I wind up for the next chapter of my career, I'm looking to continue to practice and fill out
				my current skills, but also learn new ones. I'm slowly going to be adding React to this website, 
				but I also want to learn D3 and other JavaScript packages. I ultimately want to pull my news history
				on the Portfolio page from a database I can update with a form to compartmentalize the code.
				<br><br>
				As always, I'm looking forward to what the future brings. No matter where I end up or what
				community I end up serving, I know I'll be fulfilling a calling, creating change and empowering
				my fellow humans. We're called to take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them,
				and that's what I plan to do!
