      Computer Engineering. While I was completing my undergrad, I worked consistently 
      for my student newspaper, The Advocate, and served in News, Features and Opinions page editor
      positions. I also was a constant staff writer and copy editor. I loved the paper, even between 
      group coding projects in C# and Java, and tried to keep both in my life.</p> <p>After graduation, I worked as a software consultant for a small company, picking up Python and OpenCV. 
      I helped to tinker and tweak a pill-counting machine, working on not only the motors, cameras and sensors, 
      but also a new user interface and video-processing logic.</p> <p>But I didn&#39;t have time to write, as well. I decided I needed to feed both halves of my brain.</p> <p>So I made the leap. I completed a masters degree in journalism at the University of Maryland 
      in May 2022. I focused on data journalism, but also learned web development for the first time.
      I worked on some incredible, collaborative investigations for the Howard Center, some of which 
      even won awards. I made news apps for exploring databases of findings. I crafted interactive maps
      aplenty. I taught myself JavaScript over winter break, and a world opened up to me.</p> <p>Out of grad school, I was picked up by USA TODAY Network&#39;s Storytelling Studio, a team of brilliant devlopers
      making new, wild, bold interactives and web components and databases to support digital article presentations.
      My understanding of JS and CSS exploded. I learned Svelte, Node, Golang and Scrollama. I made 
      scolling narratives that twist maps and models at each step to visually explain investigations. I made it easier 
      for series of articles to pull the same data powering recirculation. I even made some data graphics.</p> <p>As always, I&#39;m looking forward to what puzzles the future brings. No matter where I end up or what
      community I end up serving, I know I&#39;ll be fulfilling a calling, creating change and empowering
      my fellow humans. We&#39;re called to take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them,
      and that&#39;s what I plan to do!</p></div>`,i;return t=new M({props:{current_page:"bio"}}),{c(){e=d("main"),w(t.$$.fragment),r=v(),n=d("div"),n.innerHTML=s,this.h()},l(a){e=l(a,"MAIN",{});var o=I(e);b(t.$$.fragment,o),r=y(o),n=l(o,"DIV",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),k(n)!=="svelte-c4jlbq"&&(n.innerHTML=s),o.forEach(p),this.h()},h(){_(n,"id","page-body")},m(a,o){S(a,e,o),x(t,e,null),m(e,r),m(e,n),i=!0},p:f,i(a){i||($(t.$$.fragment,a),i=!0)},o(a){A(t.$$.fragment,a),i=!1},d(a){a&&p(e),C(t)}}}class T extends h{constructor(e){super(),g(this,e,null,N,u,{})}}export{T as component};
