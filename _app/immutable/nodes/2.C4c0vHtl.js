      programming, sometimes as a full-time stringer and sometimes as purely a software developer.
      I&#39;ve had the most fun in the middle: I&#39;ve crafted deep-dive data stories, relying on R skills to bolster 
      my conclusions, and I&#39;ve built web components for huge news networks, taking requests from editors.</p> <p>I love local news and empowering residents to take action and stay informed in their local
